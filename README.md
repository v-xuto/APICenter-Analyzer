## :bulb: What is Azure API Center?

[Azure API Center](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-center/overview) is a service that helps you develop and maintain a structured inventory of your organization’s APIs. With API Center, you can track all of your APIs in a centralized location, regardless of their type, lifecycle stage, or deployment location. API Center enables API discovery, reuse, and governance empowering API Platform Teams.

### :memo: API Governance & Azure API Center

API governance is a critical aspect of managing APIs across an organization. It involves establishing and enforcing policies and procedures that guarantee the quality, consistency, security, and compliance of APIs. Effective API governance not only maximizes the value of an organization's API portfolio but also reduces complexity, eliminates redundancy, and mitigates potential risks.

For API Platform Teams, governance is crucial as it guides them in designing, building, and deploying APIs that align with the organization's objectives, standards, and best practices.

To facilitate robust API governance, we're excited to introduce **API Analysis** in Azure API Center. API Analysis employs API linting, a technique that validates your API specifications against a predefined set of rules or standards. With API Analysis, you can ensure your APIs adhere to your organization's guidelines and best practices, making them consistently secure and compliant.

> API Analysis currently supports OpenAPI v2, v3.x, and AsyncAPI specifications uploaded as JSON or YAML files.

### :memo: API Analysis in Azure API Center (Overview)

Here is a high-level overview of how API analysis works in Azure API Center

## :rocket: How to Run API Analysis

### :wrench: Configure your environment

Before you get started, make sure you have the following requirements in place:

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio).
- [Node.js 18.x](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/) or above. Use the `node --version` command to check your version.
- [TypeScript 4.x](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Use the `tsc -v` command to check your version.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on one of the [supported platforms](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/requirements#_platforms).
- The [Azure Functions extension v1.10.4](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions) or above for Visual Studio Code.
- [Azure Functions Core Tools v4.0.5382 or above](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local?tabs=windows%2Cisolated-process%2Cnode-v4%2Cpython-v2%2Chttp-trigger%2Ccontainer-apps&pivots=programming-language-typescript#install-the-azure-functions-core-tools).
- [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd).
- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

### :wrench: Running the sample using the Azure Developer CLI (azd)

The Azure Developer CLI (`azd`) is a developer-centric command-line interface (CLI) tool for creating Azure applications.

After logging in with the following command, you will be able to use the `azd` cli to quickly provision and deploy the application.

```
# Authenticate with Azure Developer CLI
azd auth login

# Authenticate with Azure CLI
az login
```

Then, run `azd up` to provision all the resources to Azure and deploy the code to those resources.

```
azd up
```

Enter an environment name and select your desired `subscription` and `location`. Then choose whether to create the monitoring resources. If you want to use an existing api center resource, pass the values for `apiCenterName` and `apiCenterResourceGroupName`. Otherwise leave them blank to create a new one. Wait a moment for the resource deployment to complete. Then you can upload your own api definition for test.

There are four scenarios:

1. New `APIC` with `monitoring`. You need to leave `apiCenterName` and `apiCenterResourceGroupName` blank and set `useMonitoring` to "True".
2. New `APIC` without `monitoring`. You need to leave `apiCenterName` and `apiCenterResourceGroupName` blank and set `useMonitoring` to "False".
3. Existing `APIC` with `monitoring`. You need to fill in `apiCenterName` and `apiCenterResourceGroupName` with an existing resource and set `useMonitoring` to "True".
4. Existing `APIC` without `monitoring`. You need to fill in `apiCenterName` and `apiCenterResourceGroupName` with an existing resource and set `useMonitoring` to "False".

(Optional) You can also set the Env variables manually using the following command to skip setting them during the `azd up` process.

```
azd env set USE_MONITORING <true/false>

azd env set APIC_NAME <your-api-center-name>

azd env set APIC_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME <your-api-center-resource-group-name>
```

You can also run the sample directly locally (See below).

### :wrench: Configure & run your function locally

- Clone the APICenter-Analyzer repository to your local machine.
- Open the Project in Visual Studio Code
- Set a breakpoint
- To start the function locally, press `F5` or the Run and Debug icon in the left-hand side Activity bar. The Terminal panel should display the Output from Azure Functions Core Tools.
- Follow the instructions in [Test your Event Grid handler locally](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/how-tos/event-grid/local-testing-event-grid) to trigger the function.

## :package: How to deploy

Follow the instructions in [Quickstart: Create a function in Azure with TypeScript using Visual Studio Code](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/create-first-function-vs-code-typescript?pivots=nodejs-model-v4#sign-in-to-azure). Start from the "Sign in to Azure" section and complete all subsequent sections.

## :page_facing_up: Custom Ruleset

This template provides you with the default OAS (OpenAPI Specification) ruleset from Spectral. To see the exact rules within the ruleset, see [OpenAPI Rules](https://docs.stoplight.io/docs/spectral/4dec24461f3af-open-api-rules).

If you want to customize your Ruleset for analysis, simply swap out the default ruleset file oas.yaml located in `{workSpaceFolder}/resources/rulesets` with any valid Spectral ruleset file. We accept all valid Spectral formats (YAML, JSON, and JavaScript). Afterward, head over to the `{workSpaceFolder}/src/constants.ts` file and update the `RulesetFileName` constant with your chosen ruleset file name.
